- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SzymonSkorupa
I'm 20 years old, young and motivated guy, who moved to Sweden to look for better life and who want to become a programmer.
I'm at the beginning of my coding journey and so excited to be here. 
I would love to learn from my friends (that i hope I will gain here) who are coding for much longer time and one day
I can become this kind of friend for someone else who want to learn. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
As my first language I chose Python, but I want to start learning C++ in my free time. 
Currently I'm learning mySQL and preparing for Django.
